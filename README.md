Snake++
======

Snake++ is a simple clone of the classic snake game, implemented in C++ using the SDL2 library.

The game is currently bound to a 800x600 window, has a moving snake and a randomly generating "food".

The snake grows as it eats food and dies if it moves outside the window or if it circles back on itself.
